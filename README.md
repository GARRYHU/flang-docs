# Flang Docs

Website: https://garryhu.github.io/flang-docs/

This is the documentation for the [Flang ](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang)(also known as "Classic Flang") project. The documentation is generated by sphinx and the annotation index of source code is generated by doxygen.

To build the HTML documentation with Sphinx, add `-DLLVM_INCLUDE_DOCS=ON` or `-DFLANG_INCLUDE_DOCS=ON` to the `cmake` command when building Classic Flang. To also build an annotated index of the source code with Doxygen, add `-DLLVM_ENABLE_DOXYGEN=ON` as well.
